      <p class="aboutmep">Hello!My name is Steve Siegel. I am 28 years old. I currently live in Plymouth, MN with my siblings Scott and Sarah, and their two dogs Pooh and Shia.
             I am a delivery driver for Maggies Family Restaurant in Wayzata, MN. When I'm not at work I enjoy watching tv and movies, as well as playing video games (on PC of course).
              When the weather is nice i like to take my sibling's dogs to the park to watch them run around. Or going out on the lake when my friends that have boats invite me.
              I'm looking forward to when i'll be able to go out to movies and restaurants again once covid is behind us. I'm also looking forward to learning a brand new skill in coding. 
              I've always enjoyed computers, mostly just from having played video games on them. So I'm excited to delv deeper into the world of computers and learn how to code. 
              Before this class I have had little experience with coding, having created a very basic html site with inline css back in a highschool class. 
              It was just enough experience to help me appreciate just how difficult and complex coding can be. Thankfuly, my sibling are also taking this boot camp, 
              so we'll be able to put our heads together and help each other out when we're stuck. Hopefully three novices together can drag each other over the finish line.
